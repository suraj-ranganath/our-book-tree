go to the folder you want to store your files in:

i have already done this:
git init

git remote add origin master <url>
git remote -v //verify remote url

Do this:

VERY IMPORTANT

//always 
git pull origin master 
//before starting a new session.
if two people are working at once, coordinate beforehand. work only on different files.

Open your favourite code editor (not notepad please) and make changes.

git add <files you changed>
git commit -m "commit message"

git status //find out which files you've changed, what git has taken note of, etc

If you have 3 small changes to make, make 3 seperate commits.
Once you make them and are going offline:

git push origin master

everytime you create a new repo associated with the Relief Reunite project:
git config user.email "suraj@reliefreunite.com"
git config user.name "surajranganath"



It's not a Git error message, it's the editor as git uses your default editor.

To solve this:

press "i" (i for insert)
write your merge message
press "esc" (escape)
write ":wq" (write & quit)
then press enter

MERGE CONFLICTS
if you want to go back to the version before the conflict then 
1)git log --pretty=oneline
2)git reset --hard <commit_before_merge>
	<commit_before_merge> = first 5 digits in appropriate ID on doing git log
