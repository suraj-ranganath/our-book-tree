go to the folder you want to store your files in:

i have already done this:
git init

git remote add origin master <url>
git remote -v //verify remote url

Do this:

VERY IMPORTANT

//always 
git pull origin master 
//before starting a new session.
if two people are working at once, coordinate beforehand. work only on different files.

Open your favourite code editor (not notepad please) and make changes.

git add <files you changed>
git commit -m "commit message"

git status //find out which files you've changed, what git has taken note of, etc

If you have 3 small changes to make, make 3 seperate commits.
Once you make them and are going offline:

git push origin master

everytime you create a new repo associated with the Relief Reunite project:
git config user.email "suraj@reliefreunite.com"
git config user.name "surajranganath"
